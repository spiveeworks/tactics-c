Tactics
=======

A top down tactical game with minimalist windows.h graphics and a lot of long term goals.

This is a game that I would like to turn into an engine within which many game ideas can be mounted.

At its core it involves polygons for terrain, circles for players and circles, triangles and lines representing projectiles and effects.
This is all planning and very little actual code at this time, but if you would like to contribute to said planning, feel free to contact me or look over what I have.
