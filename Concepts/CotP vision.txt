This was the main vision for a game "Clash of the Programmers", a game idea that gave me the 'terminal' in the tactics project (and in fact, both other control methods.)

the vision was that you controlled programmed robots in a subterranean area on a distant planet, and they had to function in accordance to the 'terminal' method itself, as they were in a blackout and thus had to be preprogrammed.
Enemies like wildlife would be script based NPCs, and oponents would be other robots and the projectile fighting would generally be kind of fun.

Other more fluffy thoughts came about, but these don't serve very well in the interest of this concept.

Different 'sensors' by which robots perceived the world in different ways would be fun as well, such as spot scanners, room scanners, movement sensors:
all providing different pros and cons to the way you are designing your 'plan' download.
The problem with this is that cons aren't obstacles but just annoyances, which make videogames bad.
